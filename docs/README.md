# PRB Portfolio Website

## Introduction
![PRB Portfolio Website Mockups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeteIG/PRB_Portfolio/main/docs/website_mockups.png)

### Project Goals
This portfolio website is designed to showcase some examples of my skills and experience as Product Manager and Founder, highlighting my experience and accomplishments in lean product development, web development and AI applications. The site is designed to provide insights into my professional journey and technical capabilities.

### User Goals
The site has two main audiences, companies who may wish to work with me as collaborators, or recruit me.
User goals are:
- To learn about my skills
- To learn about my experience
- To understand whether I am credible
- To learn more about me as a person (hobbies, interests, etc.)
- To navigate the site easily
- To get in contact with me if they wish 

The site is a great way to meet these goals because:
- The project sections provide real-world examples of my skills and experience 
- The Bio section provides a more detailed summary overview of my achievements
- The Bio section adds credibility by sharing some of the well known organisations that I have worked with
- The Bio section shares some of my personal hobbies and interests along with images 
- It is a clean, modern design 
- The site is responsive and easy to navigate
- It has been developed from scratch as the first Milestone project for my Diploma in Full-stack web development and is therefore itself another real-world example of my skills/experience. 

## User Stories
1.	As a tech recruiter, I want to easily understand Pete's core competencies and technical skills, so that I can quickly assess if he fits our company's needs.
•	Met by: Clear categorisation of skills and competencies in the homepage summary, specific project examples, and bio section.
2.	As a startup founder, I want to view examples of Pete's previous projects, including his role and contributions, to evaluate his experience and problem-solving abilities.
•	Met by: A 'Projects' section showcasing detailed case studies of key projects worked on.
3.	As a potential collaborator, I need to easily find Pete's contact information, so that I can reach out to him for potential partnerships or collaborative projects.
•	Met by: A visible 'Contact' section with more than one contact option, including a form, and LinkedIn.


## Technology Stack
**Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
**Tools**: Gitpod, GitHub, Balsamiq, Adobe CC. 

## Installation?

## Usage
Navigate through the website to view different projects I've worked on. Projects includes a detailed description of what I have worked on, challenges I have encountered and what I have learned. 

Only one of the example projects (MobilityHub) has been populated for the purposes of the Milestone project, as it was beyond the scope to create and populate each project page. Other projects will  be populated in due course, and as my Technical coding skills improve I will also add examples of future coding projects. 

Other areas which are incomplete due to being outside of scope are the contact form which simulates a successful message, but is not hooked up to a database. So if you would like to get in touch, please use LinkedIn.

## Acknowledgements
In creating this website I relied heavily upon: 
- Code Institute course tutorials
- Documentation at https://getbootstrap.com/
- Documentation at https://fontawesome.com/
- Troubleshooting at https://stackoverflow.com/
- For the Mockup generator on various screen sizes I used https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php  

## Bugs
*I had a lot of difficulty making the navbar sticky. The sticky-top class should have worked but didn't, and I could not find anywhere in the code where bootstrap or css was overriding it. *Resolved Found the answer in stackoverflow chat explaining that sticky-top will not work unless it is applied to the outermost element (which it wasn't), In this case the class needed to be applied to the header, and not the nav element.

*I have not been able to centre the image on the contact form success page.

*There is a scalling issue withe the work examples on the home page where, at medium screen sizes, the top row is splitting into two vertically stacked images while the second row remains horizontally stacked.
