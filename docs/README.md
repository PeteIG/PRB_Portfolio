# PRB Portfolio Website

The site can be accessed by this [link](https://peteig.github.io/PRB_Portfolio/)


## Introduction
![PRB Portfolio Website Mockups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeteIG/PRB_Portfolio/main/docs/website_mockups.png)


## Usage
Navigate through the website to view different projects I've worked on. Projects includes a detailed description of what I have worked on, challenges I have encountered and what I have learned. 

Only one of the example projects (MobilityHub) has been populated for the purposes of the Milestone project, as it was beyond the scope to create and populate each project page. Other projects will  be populated in due course, and as my Technical coding skills improve I will also add examples of future coding projects. 

Other areas which are incomplete due to being outside of scope are the contact form which simulates a successful message, but is not hooked up to a database. So if you would like to get in touch, please use LinkedIn.

### Project Goals
This portfolio website is designed to showcase some examples of my skills and experience as Product Manager and Founder, highlighting my experience and accomplishments in lean product development, web development and AI applications. The site is designed to provide insights into my professional journey and technical capabilities.


### User Goals
The site has two main audiences, companies who may wish to work with me as collaborators, or recruit me.
User goals are:
- To learn about my skills
- To learn about my experience
- To understand whether I am credible
- To learn more about me as a person (hobbies, interests, etc.)
- To navigate the site easily
- To get in contact with me if they wish 

The site is a great way to meet these goals because:
- The project sections provide real-world examples of my skills and experience 
- The Bio section provides a more detailed summary overview of my achievements
- The Bio section adds credibility by sharing some of the well known organisations that I have worked with
- The Bio section shares some of my personal hobbies and interests along with images 
- It is a clean, modern design 
- The site is responsive and easy to navigate
- It has been developed from scratch as the first Milestone project for my Diploma in Full-stack web development and is therefore itself another real-world example of my skills/experience.

## Design

### Color Scheme

![Colour Palette](documentation/)

- The primary colour palette of my website comprises shades that align closely with my company's branding. This choice ensures a cohesive visual experience and guarantees that the images and content on the site seamlessly integrate with these colours.

- The dominant use of blues and greys in the palette not only reflects the professional and technological focus of my work but also creates a clean and modern aesthetic. These colours are known for their calming effects and associations with trust and reliability, which are key in my field of software and technology.

- Accents of brighter colours are used sparingly to draw attention to important elements like call-to-action buttons and key highlights, ensuring they stand out against the more muted background colours.

### Typography

![Main Font](documentation/)

- For the main body of text, I've chosen a clean and modern sans-serif font that enhances readability and maintains a professional look throughout the site. This font was selected for its clarity and ease of reading, which is crucial for effectively communicating complex technical information.


### Design Rationale

- The overall design, from the colour scheme to the typography, was carefully chosen to align with my company's branding while ensuring the site is approachable, user-friendly, and reflective of the professional standards in software development and technology. The goal was to create a harmonious balance between aesthetics and functionality, making the website not only a showcase of my projects but also an embodiment of my professional ethos.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Webflow, a no-code tool that I am very comfortable with. Multiple screenshots (where necessary) are used to show full content of each page on Desktop view, and single screenshots are used to show sections of each page on tablet or mobile view.

## Bugs
*I had difficulty making the navbar sticky. The sticky-top class should have worked but did not. I could not find where in the code bootstrap or css was overriding it. *Resolved: I found the answer in stackoverflow chat explaining that sticky-top will not work unless it is applied to the outermost element (which it wasn't), In this case the class needed to be applied to the header, and not the nav element. This change has been applied.

*I have not been able to centre the image on the contact form success page.

*There was a scalling issue with the work examples on the home page where, at medium screen sizes, the top row was splitting into two vertically stacked images while the second row remained horizontally stacked. The issue had been caused by applying the <a> tag to the outermost div rather than to the div containing the image.
